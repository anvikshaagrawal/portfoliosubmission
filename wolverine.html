Especially during colder months, walking long distances can be brutal and many students prefer to drive to save time. Additionally, not all off-campus residences come with parking spots, so some students need to find a place to reliably keep their car for the year. Many students do not have the money to purchase a university parking pass or pay for parking garages and street parking regularly.</td>
          <td>Wolverine parking is a savior for students at the University of Michigan who do not want to waste their precious time searching for a parking spot in the city of Ann Arbor. Not all off campus residential complexes offer a complimentary parking spot and not all spaces near the campus are free to park during all time of the day. In addition it also offer students to sell a parking spot in order to make some money.</td>

    <h3>Sketching & Probable Solution Ideas</h3>
    <p>Getting deeper into the problem after conducting the interviews I came up with different types of solutions possible to cater to the ruckus of parking in Ann Arbor. I made sure to go extremely out of the box and come up with 8 unique solutions.</p>
    <div class="flip-card">
      <div class="flip-card-inner">
        <div class="flip-card-front">
          <img id="flip" src="images/persona1.jpg" alt="storyboard option1"/>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <img id="flipp" src="images/persona2.jpg" alt="storyboard option2"/>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h3>What kind of personas did I make ?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Post the interviews, I synthesized all the findings and created the most eligible personas. This helped me to form an established foundation and made me prioritize my customer needs. My target users are the students of the Ann Arbor who either want to park at a particular spot or sell an existing parking spot. I also created an anti-persona to make sure that viewers can be sure of the users who I am not catering to.  </p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>How did I ideate before coming to my design decisions</h3>
    <br>
    <p>I implemented a participatory design approach to the solution by involving all the stakeholders. Participatory design helps create solutions for people by people. This process reduces the risk of failure and eventually cuts the production cost too. Realistic expectations can be understood. Everyone has their own process of storing new knowledge, whether it is people entering the UIX community or users trying to learn a new instrument. This process mostly deals with stages and the involvement of the stakeholders in those stages.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Why and how did I do the storymapping to get to the problem</h3>
    <br>
    <p>I proceeded by creating a detailed story-map to represent all the possible steps that the users might take. The steps were based on the individual story-mapping of each persona. An individual story-map was created for each persona and finally all of them were combined to produce the final story-map. This helped me in analyzing all the various tangents in the designing of the application.</p>
    <br><br>
      <h3>What were the final takeaways from my project!</h3>
    <br>
    <p>My solutions revolved around providing a platform that helps the students of Ann Arbor to find/ book/ sell a parking spot. Everyday, thousands of students waste time on traffic and search places to park. This study is a way to help all those in need to have a little more time to complete their daily goals in the most efficient way. Thus users save time and can easily find a reliable and budgeted spot.</p>
   <br>
   <p>The user is allowed to add specific details to enrich the description of the parking spot and is offered in various languages, the product makes personalized communication with the user.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The solution has been designed solely keeping the need in mind and not the various features to be incorporated. I realized that throughout the building process my design evolved at various stages. By the feedback from the user tests I incorporated more features to ease out the entire experience and process. The process of iterative user research and prototyping helped me sync the needs of the user and the aesthetic output that I wanted to produce as a designer.</p>
